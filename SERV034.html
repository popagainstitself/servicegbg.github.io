Like State’08, this  melancholic  beauty is a one off-single recorded by Dan and with artwork by Carl Hammoud.
<br><br>
The release was a conceptual play with the drastically transforming conditions for music distribution at the time. 
The predominant medium had shifted from CD to file sharing, while the transition to streaming had not yet taken off. 
<br><br>
We thought it fun to face our new lack of control and connection by reversing it in a rather aggressive way: 
We kept access to the music to an exclusive minimum, and engraved the monetary connection into the medium itself.

				Erik’s work is something else, something more, than what usually ends up on record. Secrets Adrift seems to be a series of transient states, as well as a method. 
					The music spreads rhizomatically; decentralized, without origin or fixed destination, and gives rise to temporary intensities. 
					”The songs have grown unplanned and spontaneous and are recorded without respect for form and structure. The music is built on a quest for inconsistency,” says Erik. 
					But it is warm and inviting nonetheless, tender and intimate like a new friend telling you secrets.
				<br><br>
				Faithful to his method, Service released the recording Erik had sent as a "demo", completely unaltered.
				<br><br>
					Mattias Nilssons’ drawing does not only illustrate Erik’s music strikingly well, but translates the rhizomatic method to visual form. 
					<br>Sound and vision takes you on an adventure, microscopic in size and boundless in scope.

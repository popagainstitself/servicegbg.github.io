Another conceptual yet highly danceable record from Service.
<br><br>
Under his Kool Dj Dust alias, Daniel Savio digged every dusty crate(r), then molded the ultra obscure materia into 19 perfect disco rocks which he arranged dramaturgically into a galactic party drama. Visualized as a graphic story by Jimmy Gustavsson: The Disco Opera
<br><br>
Dr. Sorryasscopycat has seized control over the city’s disco in order to control the people's minds and bodies by the most horrible means: lifeless music, oppressing everyone’s party spirit.
<br><br>
The last hope stands to an ancient prophecy that a child will be born with the power to liberate the people. But the prophecy also speaks about a long-forgotten artifact, the Magic Record, without which this cannot be done…
<br><br><br>
Of course, ultimately The Disco Opera is the story about itself.
<br>
And its prophecy will be fulfilled only by YOU dancing to it.

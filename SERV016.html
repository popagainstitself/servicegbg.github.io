This Ep - the third in the "Silent Jens" triology - contains more ideas than most artists' entire career. The abundance is astonishing.
<br><br>
Getting lost in the past is a recurring theme.
<br>
In "Julie" Jens offers to trade himself for a cigarette lighter with a girl that seems stuck and in need of guidance.
<br>
"I Saw Her In The Anti-War Demonstration" could be a sequel to "Do You Remember the Riots?", Eros' arrows again finding Jens amidst political tension.
<br>
The two "Hammer Hill" songs are nostalgic look-backs on Jens' young life in his Göteborg suburb Hammarkullen. The first brilliantly centres around samples from a bootleg of 
Jens' unofficial gig in the Emmaboda festival camping; The sound of the small crowd cheering and shouting for their favourite Jens songs captures the drunken enthusiasm of youth. 
					In the second song, memories of violence compete with the beauty of the summer evening. 
<br>
"A Man Walks Into A Bar" amazingly transforms a couple of bad jokes into heartbreak memories and loss.

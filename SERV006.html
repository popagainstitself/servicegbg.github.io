					Pitchfork has quite correctly called The Embassy ”the architects of some of the past decades’ best new sounds”. 
					With its blending of acoustic and digital elelements into a light and dreamy sound, elegant melodics and subtle lyrics, Futile Crimes – 
					Service’s first album release – is the landmark work that opened the Göteborg 00:s era; a new chapter for music in Sweden and beyond.<br><br>
					However, The Embassy are neither contemporary nor ”timeless”, but untimely: in favour, hopefully, of a time to come.<br><br>
					Stefan Zachrisson's liner note captures this: "They always... considered themselves outsiders. Vulnurable and open to attack. Of course they knew it was a romantic, even pathetic, notion. ... 
					They grew up and they didn't change, because things didn't change. ... So the discontent was used for the fleeting, bright feeling of the peculiar thing we spell p-o-p."<br><br>
					The artwork by Ola and Artur Zarkowski continues the pop coloured heraldy graphics of Ola's club night Lolita, which – like The Embassy – combined local indie and house music.

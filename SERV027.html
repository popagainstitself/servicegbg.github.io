					Extremely improbable and surprising, Moodymann played my favourite track from the album - Done With You - in his DJ set at Fredsgatan in Stockholm one summer night.
<br><br>
After the set, I happened to find Moodymann in the men's room and told him I had been loving his music ever since Silent Introduction. He replied rather laconically, dick in hand, "That's a long time".
<br><br>
Perplexed, I didn't ask about his Done With You choice. Could it have to do with the band's name and Moodymann being such a strong advocate for black culture…?

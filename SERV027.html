						Extremely surprising and improbable, my idol Moodymann played my favourite track from this album - Done With You - in his DJ set at Fredsgatan in Stockholm one summer night. 
						After the set, I happened to find Moodymann in the men's room and told him I had been loving his music ever since Silent Introduction. He replied rather laconically, dick in hand, "That's a long time".

						<br><br>
						Perplexed, I didn't think of asking about him the Done With You choice. Perhaps it had something to do with the band's name and Moodymann being such an advocate for black culture in Detroit?

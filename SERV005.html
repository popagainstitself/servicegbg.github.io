					1 The Pointer<br>
					2 Make Me Sad (Vic Godard)
				</li>
				<li>
					The fact that Embassy were mailmen was the economic foundation for Service: it meant unlimited access to free postage for our operations. 
					The second song on our first CD release is a Subway Sect cover. Vic Godard of that band was a mailman too. When both band played the same town once, they swapped postal uniform shirts. 
					The artwork, made by Rasmus with Ola, continues the eerie silhouette theme. It is reflecting the Pointer lyric by questioning who is watching who: Who is being exposed in this bright black twilight?

					ARTWORK: Rasmus Hägg and Ola Borgström<br>
					RECORDED BY: Björn Olsson

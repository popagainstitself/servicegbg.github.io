					Well I wrote you that song a long time ago<br>
					It was all I could do to try to let you know<br>
					But the metaphores might have come in the way<br>
					Of the things I was really trying to say
					<br><br>
					Late era Service masterpiece.
		<br><br>
					Music leading towards the eidos of pop. Ten heavenly melodies, composed and produced with extraordinary refinement, surely playing on repeat on Radio Topos Ouranos. It is no surprise that the album is yet to be discovered by many, as it takes time for ears to get used to such brightness.
		<br><br>
Lake Heartbeat turn the fundamental metaphysical wonder around and ask: Why is there nothing rather than something?
The album starts with an ambition to solve the mystery, but ends with only a restatement: ”Like a house on fire, first it’s there then it’s gone.” The object of investigation being, of course, love. 
		<br><br>
To examine the matter, Lake Heartbeat occasionally turn to scientific discourse. It doesn’t solve the enigma, but the encounter between gentle query and passion makes for particularly dignified lyrics.
		<br><br>
Eventually some insight can be reached, not with numbers but by change of perspective: Consider love not as a thing that is or is not, but as a force that create things. Things change, love remains.
		<br><br>
If their music is otherworldly yet utterly real, something similar can be said about the band. Untouched by the public eye, the duo did not appear in photos or videos and never played live. Despite my deep admiration, we only ever met once or twice. Their songs reached me, I took on the A&R role and asked Dan to help produce the album. I’m not sure Lake Heartbeat had even intended to release their music, yet it’s one of the greatest pop records to ever descend from Sweden. 
		<br><br>
This ghostlike presence of absence is reflected by the artwork. <br>

At this point, Service was shifting from local culture to projects of more conceptual character. Pop art to dance to, if you like.
<br><br>
Here Service went spectral, conjuring up the presence of absence. (Coincidentally awarded Vice’s ”Label of the year” – the only year the label didn’t release any new music.)
<br><br>
Jackpot was presented as a found tapes project, which attracted numerous rumors – most implausible, none confirmed, many collected on the Jackpot Research blog:
jackpotresearch.wordpress.com
<br><br>
One legend has it that Jackpot’s music originally functioned as a pretext to press records of a narcotic solution, in order to smuggle drugs.
<br><br>
According to another, the recordings originally surfaced when E-Type stumbled upon the Ampex master tape - marked ”Pedro’s Sound Taco, Februari, 1991”. - at a garage sale a few miles outside Skå by Mälaren when scouting locations for the ”vikingaby” he planned to build.
<br><br>
Another told of Jackpot’s Gleen Asp isolating himself in a bunker built into a cliff on Instön in order to evade the Swedish tax authorities after a failed investment in a tanning-parlor franchise. While the other half of the duo, Marco Donatello, had worked as stand-in actor for the furry extraterrestrial ALF in an episode of the eponymous 1980s sitcom.
<br><br>
Yet another recalls that their single “Ragazza” managed to - due to a complicated case of copyright infringement - simultaneously chart on 1st and 2nd place on the Swedish radio show Tracks, before it was disqualified.
<br>
And so on, and so on.
<br><br>
The blog posts ignited serious sleuthing among the internet’s disco rarities collectors.
<br><br>
When the dust settled, one unquestionable fact remained: These are haunting yet highly enjoyable, dirty disco tracks.
<br><br>
Found before they were lost.

				SERV021. The Embassy - Some Indulgence.
<br><br>
One of the most beautiful episodes from Service is how TTA used all their time in the limelight to praise The Embassy. TTA educated on the pureness and beauty of Futile Crimes, and so seriously contributed to set the stage for Tacking.
<br><br>
That Some Indulgence was anticipated is to say the least. Constantly DJ:ed and massively hyped by the Service crew for months in advance, it was a hit long before it was even released. 
<br><br>
Lyrically this monumental single is the perfect another for The Embassy as well as for Service. But instead of letting it wrap everything up, we let the composition’s open end point to the future.
<br><br>
Easy times for loutish people<br>
rules were written for you folks<br>
I estimate of gettin even<br>
my chance is none
 <br><br>
I gave to you<br>
my lies my ambition my hope<br>
and ’la haine’ of course<br>
if that is what you’re waiting for<br>
now take it, it’s yours
 <br><br>
I thought that if we’d only speak up<br>
maybe you would get the words<br>
I thought that if you’d come and see us<br>
you would return
 <br><br>
I gave to you<br>
my lies my ambition my hope<br>
and some love of course<br>
if that is what you’re waiting for<br>
now take it, it’s yours

					Remixes and a sweet acoustic from the Tacking era.

					This being a mass-produced artifact of copyrighted remix versions of original compositions, Ola and Stefan Fält made the artwork a philosophical funfair horrorshow on the theme of original/copy, identity/difference and hermeneutics.
					<br><br>
					TThe original-derived/copy hierarchy is fundamental to Western metaphysics – itself historically transferred through interpretation.
					<br><br>
					What is an original? How does the copy relate to the original? How does an interpretation (a remix, in this case) involve the identity of what’s being interpreted? 
					Is an interpretation itself a new original, or are there only interpretations of interpretations? Are there no originals, but copies of copies? Is the authoritarian regime 
					of original/copy overthrown altogether by the ontological anarchy of simulacra, or replaced by the fabric of interpretation? Is it difference itself that is eternally recurring?
					<br><br>
					The CD manufacturer was confused and asked for confirmation that they should indeed print the booklet with eleven identical pages.
					<br><br>
					Needless to say, this release is available on CD only.
					<br><br>
					An exhibition was made in Stockholm with the artwork enlarged and backlighted.

					Do you realise that  the name Spotify is a verb meaning the placing of advertising spots in music; to spotify music?
					Can you imagine my response when someone from the then start-up called and asked for my opinion about PLACING ADVERTS IN OUR MUSIC?
					<br><br>
					The Service Clan was an attempt to avoid this nightmarish future scenario, while accepting that music will be predominantly digitally distributed. <br>
					The idea was that I would send all future Service releases digitally (and a sew-on badge if I remember correctly?) to anyone who joined our life long membership (at the price of € 30).	<br>
					Now would definately be the time to go back to this idea...	
					<br><br>
					Even though State'08 was released without the context of an album, tour or anything else – basically in a vacuum – 
					the song was an unexpected radio hit. It spent several weeks on highest rotation on Swedish national radio, probably making it  
					one of our most publicly successful releases.
					<br><br>
					Perhaps the song is so good because it is product of the local culture of real life relations that I'd like to understand as the essence of Service.
					It was produced and recorded by Dan (Studio) in TTA's studio on Nordhemsgatan.
					<br><br>
					The artwork is a watercolour by Carl Hammoud, a classmate and friend of Dan's at Valand Art School. We'd frequently hang out during those days. 
					But while me and Dan were doing label work and Dionysian chaos, Carl, a disciplined and talanted painter, was developing a great body of work and career. 
					It makes beautiful sense he's part of the catalog.

After Tacking, Service went searching outside Göteborg. And did find indeed some gems. 

Harlem from Stockholm was the first one. Their music seemed to fit perfectly in the international, eclectic, club oriented soundscape that had emerged. 
Combining electronics and suggestive vocal hooks, their result is red hot tech funk.
<br><br>
Tomas Andersson, who did a remix on this Ep, actually had one of the bigger hits of that scene to his name. 
<br><br>
The great artwork was made by Helsinki based design collective Vänskap, also responsible for Tacking.
<br><br>
Sit back, keep your eyes on the track.

Jens’ second album collects his three first Ep:s: The classic "Maple Leaves Ep", the limited edition "Rocky Dennis in Heaven Ep", "Julie Ep" plus a couple of new tracks.
<br><br>
When the time came to give this record a title, Jens had disappeared. Ola at Service did not hear from him before deadline, so he named it ”Oh, You’re So Silent Jens”. It’s of course a lyric quote from Black Cab, but also a message to Jens in absentia.
<br><br>
Rasmus’ artwork is a genius design solution. It may take some time to realise that the mountainous landscape actually represents the three Ep:s that the album compiles.
<br><br>
The photo in the booklet is probably from the unauthorised show Jens played at the Emmaboda camping and that was bootlegged (you can see a tape recorder in the picture), leeked onto the internet, and then downloaded and sampled by Jens for ”Hammer Hill” on this very album.
<br><br>
So yes a lot of self-referencing hidden on this one.

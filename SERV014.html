				<li><h2>The Embassy - Wearing Our Pop Art Hearts On Our Sleeves</h2></li>

				<li>
					1 Information<br>
					2 Flipside of a Memory<br>
					3 New Plans

				</li>
				<li>
					Three tracks marking The Embassy’s excitingly uncertin position between their first album and the future.<br><br>
				
					The Embassy’s artwork is picturing a live situation with the least popular and least successful band coming of the Madchester scene. The liner note by Stefan Zachrisson reads a curious clue concerning the disappearence of The Embassy, written in 1924.
<br><br>
					All this reflecting the complexes and paradoxes of a radical pop (in)activist duo, whose music seems to be more confidently relaxed, warm and generous the more the band is communicating in ambiguous codes.
<br><br>
					The Embassy surely is the only band whose song titles have given name to at least three different record labels, by the way.

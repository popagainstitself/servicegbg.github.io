					This must be one of the weirdest record artworks ever to hit No. 1 on the Swedish album chart. 
<br><br>
By the time of peak popularity in Sweden, Jens decided to move to Australia. His absence again left an awkward hole in the award show industry.
<br><br>
A few years earlier, when his first album was nominated for three Swedish Grammis, Jens was nowhere to be seen. In his absence, the producer had Tommy Körberg sing ”You Are the Light” with Wille Craaford in a campfire setting. It was utterly confusing.
<br><br>
This time on P3 Guld, again being nominated for three awards, Jens sent a video message while rowing a small boat down the Yarra River outside Melbourne. Not even I cared to attend the show this night, so no one was there to pick up Jens’ prize. I wonder what that looked like on TV. 
<br><br>
A couple of days later, Metro published a brief interview with someone who had found the award prize at Pizza Hut Klarabergsgatan in Stockholm. The show had been in Göteborg, 500 kilometers away. It was utterly confusing.
<br><br>
Jens and Marcus Söderlund  went to Iceland and actually did fly in a small propeller plane each to make the video for ”Sipping On the Sweet Nectar”.
<br><br>
Jens samples TTA on this album, and  Burial samples Jens from it. What an incredible trinity, right?

This must be one of the weirdest record artworks ever to hit No. 1 on the Swedish album chart.
<br><br>
Jens' music was omnipresent, and the record topped every year-end list.
<br><br>
At the time of peak popularity in Sweden, Jens decided to disappear to Australia. This move again left an awkward hole in the award show industry.
<br><br>
A couple of years earlier, when his first album was nominated for three Swedish Grammis, Jens was gone too. In his absence, the producer had Tommy Körberg sing ”You Are the Light” with Wille Craaford in campfire setting. It was utterly confusing.
<br><br>
This time on P3 Guld, again being nominated for three awards, Jens sent a video message while rowing a small boat down the Yarra River. I didn't care to attend the show, so no one was there to accept Jens’ award. I wonder what that looked like on TV.
<br><br>
A few days later, Metro published an interview with someone who had found the award price at a Pizza Hut in Stockholm. 500 kilometers away from the show in Göteborg. It was utterly confusing.
<br><br>
Jens and Marcus Söderlund actually went all the way to Iceland and did fly a small propeller plane each to make the video for ”Sipping On the Sweet Nectar”.
<br><br>
Jens’ first idea for an album title was A Drop of Blood in a Glass of Milk. Such a poetic image! I’m glad it’s part of the artwork, albeit in a symbolic way.
<br><br>
I love that Jens samples TTA on the album, and that Burial samples Jens. What an incredible trinity!

Cat5 challenged expectations at the time, and magnificently so.
<br><br>
This is laser guided pop at its purest, yet raw DIY. Christina and Hanna had an unusually complete set of skills, guaranteeing their vision and independence: They wrote, recorded, produced, mixed and performed their music.
<br><br>
The result is as direct as it is diverse. Listen to tracks like I Want You, Slow Down and the pop house single Stretch and Bend. They all still sound remarkably fresh.
<br><br>
Christina and Hanna deserve a life long adventure in music. Their creative symbiosis is beautifully illustrated by Stefan Fält’s excellent artwork.
<br><br>
In order to maximize the album’s reach, Service licensed it to a major record company – an experiment not to be repeated.

his band challenged expectations at the time, and magnificently so. <br><br>

Gloriously artificial, this is pop at its purest. Yet it’s die-hard DIY. Christina and Hanna had a rare and complete set of skills and did what few people can: they wrote, recorded, produced, mixed and performed.
<br><br>
The result is as direct as it is diverse. Listen to album tracks like Slow Down and I Want You, and the pop house single Stretch and Bend. They still sound strikingly fresh.
<br><br>
Their creative symbiosis is beautifully illustrated by Stefan Fält’s artwork.

In order to maximize the album’s reach, Service licensed it to a major record company – an experiment not to be repeated.

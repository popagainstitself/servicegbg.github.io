This band challenged a lot of expectations at the time, and magnificently so.
<br><br>
This is laser guided pop its purest, yet hardcore DIY. Christina and Hanna have a complete set of skills, guaranteeing their vision and independence: They wrote, recorded, produced, mixed and performed.
<br><br>
The result is as direct as it is diverse. Just listen to album tracks like I Want You and Play This Loud, their remix of Robyn's Crash and Burn Girl, and the pop house single Stretch and Bend.
<br><br>
Rather than a matter of some mysterious "talent", production is always collective. Stefan Fält’s excellent artwork is beautifully illustrating Christina and Hanna's creative symbiosis.
<br><br>
In order to maximize the album’s reach, Service licensed it to a major record company – an experiment not to be repeated.

					The Tough Alliance's idiosyncratic production technique, pure pop melodies and brother/sisterhood layalty and love have forever redefined music in Sweden and beyond. <br>
					But even more so, their fundamental deconstruction and subvertion of the hierarcic dichotomies artist and audience, performer and consumer, active and passive, have altered our conceptions, 
					freed us and enabled us to find new and true connection and community. If Sex Pistols ends with with Lydon's "Have you ever felt that you've been cheated?" then that's where TTA starts: 
					The way TTA annulled conventional relations in pop subverted the core of capitalist culture and opened a situation that set us collectively free.<br><br>
					And that's of course precisely why it could not possibly be sustained in a conventional, representable or reified form: It was i true event.

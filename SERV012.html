					SERV012. Jens Lekman & José González.<br> <br> 

					This split single is a manifestation of these great talent's sold out show together at the Göteborg symphonic concert hall, 
					with just one Ep/album out between them. The concert was filmed and broadcasted by Swedish national television.<br> <br> 

                    Jens’ song is an invitation to anyone to have him sing at their wedding. His latest album is about his experiences from doing just that.<br> <br> 

            		Great artwork by Jens, printed on gold paper.

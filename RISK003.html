It may come as a surprise, but Service was actually behind this. <br><br>

I was woken at three in the morning by my friend Luciano and Andreas Kleerup calling to excitedly insist I listen to the latter’s fresh tune over the phone. My drowsiness quickly gave way as the intensity of the song increased. 
<br><br>
It sounded like a glazed, Nordic, Unfinished Sympathy. But more, it is a monument of existential tragedy. Robyn’s vocals have never been stronger, giving voice to the unbearable experience of being crushed between future and past. 
<br><br>
Time mercilessly commands movement in one direction, which means the loss of everything that was. You must go forward, but every step means leaving. Every heartbeat is hurting.
<br><br>
The structure of the composition expresses this by dividing itself in before and after – at the weightless, word and worldless violin break – transforming itself into a steady march of pain, dying with every relentless step.
<br><br>
Borges (the blind librarian) has described our linear conception of time as entrapment in the most horrible labyrinth: the straight path.
<br><br>
It was not possible to go back to sleep after that.
<br><br>
An agreement was immediately entered for release on Service. 
<br><br>
A few months later this came to the attention of Virgin/EMI, who then suddenly recalled an old contract with Kleerup they kept in a dusty drawer, which enabled them to hi-jack the project. It’s not my first unpleasant experience with a major record company, but this one hurt. 
<br><br>
The single first came out on vinyl on Service’s sub-label Risky Dazzle, and later on Virgin. The following summer, the song hit no. 1 on the UK singles chart and was certified platinum. Which I guess kickstarted Robyn’s international career.
<br><br>
Though I wish it had played out differently, I am bitterly glad this incredible song is part of Service’s story.

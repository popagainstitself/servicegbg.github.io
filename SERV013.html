Henning and Eric were long time friends of Ola’s little brother, often going straight to school from the afters at Ola’s place. Then they left town for a couple of years to quietly work on something. It was a family’s embrace that welcomed them to Service upon return.

Nobody had ever heard anything like this before. You’d struggle to describe it, but the power is undeniable, You could feel it's the start of something new, something special. It was clear that wherever this went it'd take over the place.
<br><br>
This release marks Service’s all conquering era, as perfectly illustrated by Dan’s imperial artwork.
